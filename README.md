# School_District_Analysis

## A school board-wide analyisis of academic performance in correlation with allotted spending, school size and school type on both individual and comprehensive proportions.

### Project Overview

This analysis is intended on reporting the academic performance versus the funding and budget metrics of the students at fifteen district and charter high schools overseen by the same school board.  During the analysis, it was discovered that the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School were skewed due to potential academic dishonesty and needed to be removed from the overall assessment. To do this, the ninth-grade scores from Thomas High School were nullified with NaN (Not a Number) values during a second analysis and a comparison was conducted to understand the overall difference between omitting the grades entirely and replacing them with Not a Number values.
